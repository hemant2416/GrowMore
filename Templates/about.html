                We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010 with the goal of breaking all barriers that
                traders and investors face in India in terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the company
                Zerodha, a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit word for barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house technology have made us the biggest stock broker
                in
                India.
